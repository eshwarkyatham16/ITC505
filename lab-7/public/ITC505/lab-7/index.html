      <h3>Server Setup</h3>
      <p>
        I set up an Express.js server to handle both static file serving and
        form submission. Middleware such as <code>express.urlencoded</code> was
        used to parse URL-encoded form data, and <code>morgan</code> was used
        for logging HTTP requests.
      </p>

      <h3>Form Design</h3>
      <p>
        The form was designed to be simple yet functional, with fields for noun,
        verb, adjective, adverb, and place. All fields are marked as required to
        ensure complete user input. Labels are provided for clarity.
      </p>

      <h3>Routing and Handling</h3>
      <p>
        A POST route <code>/ITC505/lab-7/index.html</code> was implemented to
        handle form submissions. The route validates the input, ensuring no
        fields are left empty, and constructs a mad lib story using the
        submitted data. If validation fails, a response prompts the user to fill
        out all fields.
      </p>

      <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
      <p>
        The form and page were styled using CSS to improve usability and
        aesthetics.
      </p>

      <h3>Verification</h3>
      <p>
        The page was tested to ensure that it loads correctly, form validation
        works, and the mad lib story is generated as expected. The last modified
        date is displayed correctly in the footer.
