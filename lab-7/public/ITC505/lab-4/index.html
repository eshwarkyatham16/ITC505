        <h1>Addendum</h1>
        <p>In creating the HTML version of my resume, I used various HTML tags to ensure that the document is well-structured and easy to read. Here's a brief overview of my reasoning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> I chose Arial as the primary font for its readability and wide availability across different devices and operating systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Heading and Text Sizes:</strong> The main text size is 1em, which provides a comfortable reading experience. The headings vary in size, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the largest at 2.5em in the header and 1.8em in the main content, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> at 1.4em, and <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> at 1.2em.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Choices:</strong> The color scheme includes a light background (#f4f4f9) for a soft visual effect, dark text (#333) for readability, and a highlight color (#00aaff) for important elements like headings and links.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin and Padding Choices:</strong> The document has consistent margins and padding to ensure adequate white space, improving readability. Sections are centered with auto margins and have padding of 20px. Headings have additional margins to separate them from the content.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>HTML Abuse</h1>
        <p>In the previous version of my resume, I used <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags for certain sections due to their visual appeal. However, I have corrected this to use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags for the highest-level headings as appropriate. This ensures proper semantic structure and accessibility of the document.</p>
