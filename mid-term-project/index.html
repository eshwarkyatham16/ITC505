        <strong>Process and Creative Choices:</strong>
        Creating the "Choose Your Own Adventure" game involved structuring a
        dynamic narrative with various paths and endings. The design choices
        were focused on simplicity and ease of interaction, ensuring users could
        easily follow the story and make choices without distraction. The
        narrative elements were complemented with relevant images to enhance the
        immersive experience.

        <strong>Challenges Faced:</strong>
        One challenge was ensuring that the story transitions smoothly between
        different states, especially at the end of the game. To address this, we
        implemented an endGame function that updates the story text, removes
        choice buttons, and presents a restart option. Another challenge was
        styling the game to be both visually appealing and responsive across
        different devices, which required careful use of CSS transitions, hover
        effects, and media queries.

        <strong>Insights Gained:</strong>
        This project provided insights into structuring interactive content in a
        way that keeps users engaged. The importance of visual feedback and
        smooth transitions became evident, as they significantly enhance user
        experience. Additionally, incorporating responsive design principles
        ensured that the game is accessible and enjoyable on both desktop and
        mobile devices.
