      <p><strong>Process and Creative Choices:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The process of developing the "Lights Out" game began with understanding
        the core mechanics of toggling cells. I decided on a 5x5 grid for
        simplicity and ease of game play. The initial focus was on setting up
        the HTML structure and basic CSS styling to create a visually appealing
        game board. Using CSS Grid allowed for a neat and flexible layout.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adding interactivity with JavaScript was the next step. I created
        functions to handle cell toggling and ensuring that clicking a cell
        would also toggle its adjacent cells. This required careful indexing to
        avoid out-of-bounds errors. To ensure the game starts with a solvable
        configuration, I implemented a randomization function that simulates
        random clicks on an initially all-off board.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "You win!" alert was added as a simple and immediate way to provide
        feedback to the player upon solving the puzzle. I also included a
        checkWin function to evaluate the board's state after each move.
      </p>

      <p>
        Styling choices were made to enhance the visual appeal and usability. A
        dark background was chosen to make the white and black cells stand out
        clearly. Hover effects were added to cells to provide feedback when the
        player interacts with them. The footer includes the last modified date
        to meet the assignment requirements.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Challenges Faced and Solutions:</strong></p>
      <p>
        One of the main challenges was ensuring that the board's random
        configuration was always solvable. This was addressed by simulating
        random clicks rather than assigning states directly. This method
        guarantees a solvable puzzle since it mimics a series of valid game
        moves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another challenge was handling edge cases where cell toggling could go
        out of bounds. This was managed by adding boundary checks within the
        toggleCell function to ensure only valid cells are toggled.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong></p>
      <p>
        This project reinforced the importance of planning and breaking down
        problems into smaller, manageable tasks. It also highlighted the value
        of testing and iterating to ensure functionality and usability. Working
        on this game improved my understanding of CSS Grid and advanced
        JavaScript event handling.
